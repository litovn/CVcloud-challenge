											<h2>Skyward Experimental Rocketry</h2>
											<h4><em>Head of Marketing & Communication &nbsp • &nbsp 2020 - 22</em></h4>
											<p><a href="https://skywarder.eu/">SkywardER</a> is a student association that builds, designs and launches sounding rockets.<br>
											As a non-profit association, we aim to coordinate the intern and outer logistics and marketing activities to fund the yearly rocket and engine projects.</p> 
											<p>As for 2022, starting funds were given for the project creation. Thanks to the department work, we found partners who invested in the association giving us products and services for the development, estimating the material rockets' final cost to be around five times its original starting fund.</p>

										<h2>On the optimization of Software Obfuscation against Hardware Trojans in Microprocessors</h2>
										<blockquote><h4><em><a href="https://re.public.polimi.it/handle/11311/1231747">IRIS PoliMi</a> &nbsp • &nbsp Paper <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1ldbiQR70npwXymmAhE-Ff5kKoiKasD27/view?usp=sharing">here</a> &nbsp • &nbsp 2021 - 22</em></h4>
										The quest for low production cost and short time-to-market, as well as the complexity of modern integrated circuits, pushed towards globalization of the supply chain of silicon devices. Such a production paradigm raised several security threats among which Hardware Trojan Horses (HTHs), which became a serious issue not only for academics but also for industry in the very last years. Indeed, it has been demonstrated that HTHs can be inserted into microprocessors allowing the attacker to run malicious software, acquire root privileges, and steal secret user information. <br>
											We present the use of software obfuscation to protect systems against HTHs that aim at stealing information from the microprocessor while it is executing a program. Moreover, we present a Genetic Algorithm-based approach to optimize the application of the anti-HTH methodology by maximizing the obtained obfuscation while minimizing the introduced overhead. <br>
											We proved the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed methodology on the Ariane 64bit RISC-V microprocessor running a set of MiBench benchmarks and cryptographic programs.</blockquote>

										<h2>The Cloud Resume Challenge</h2>
										<blockquote>The Cloud Resume Challenge is a 16-step challenge designed for beginners to get hands-on experience with some of the tools and applications that DevOps Engineers and Cloud Architects use in their day-to-day tasks.<br>
											The steps outlined in the CRC were intentionally high-level and incredibly vague, providing a fun and sometimes challenging learning opportunity <a href="https://cloudresumechallenge.dev/docs/the-challenge/aws/">here</a>.</blockquote>
