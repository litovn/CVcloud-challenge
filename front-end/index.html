											<h2>Skyward Experimental Rocketry</h2>
											<h4 style="text-align:left;padding-left:30px"><em>Head of Relationship Management</em> <span style="float:right;">2020 - 2022</span> </h4>
											<p style="padding-left:30px" align="justify">In my growing role as a relationship manager with <a href="https://contabo.skywarder.eu/pyxis-en/">SkywardER</a>, a student-led association devoted to the design, construction, and launch of experimental sounding rockets in scientific and competitive missions, I played a fundamental part in leading our projects towards success. This includes tasks such as driving collaboration across different departments, forming strategic partnerships, and overseeing procurement and budget planning processes.<br><br> 
												Very importantly to note, I have managed the Pyxis project from inception in 2021 through successfully raising the initial investment which later grew five times based on the management of relations with other parties and partnership building. That success signalled my capacity to drive better project funding and facilitate better technological advancement. <br> With processes in place from procurement to partnership agreements and harmonious operations among departments, I made a significant contribution to the project implementation and public relations and strategic positioning of the association. <br><br> 									
												In 2022, our team realized an outstanding win in the European Rocketry Challenge in Portugal. The project, Pyxis, was an embodiment of excellent teamwork and high-level technical competency, which therefore led to being the best. This achievement brought the Technical Award for an outstanding technical report, the ANACOM Award for the best spectrum, team playing without one single mistake, and maximum flight performance. The fact of achievement with the exact apogee of 3033 meters with just 1.1% deviation and measured by SRAD Electronics exemplifies our project being quite exemplary in execution and innovation.</p>

											<h2>IES Italia</h2>
											<h4 style="text-align:left;padding-left:30px"><em>Junior Blockchain Developer</em> <span style="float:right;">2018 - 2019</span> </h4>
											<p style="padding-left:30px" align="justify">At IES Italia, I started an Internship as a Technical Document Translator, which enabled me to better shape my technical communication skills. My focus than transitioned into the role of a Junior Blockchain Developer, taking part in the development of <a href="https://tngrm.io/">Tangram</a>, a blockchain platform designed to reshape video encoding services through peer-to-peer technology functioning on the Ethereum network.<br> 
												I carved a niche in enhancing platform security through the application of cryptographic techniques. My part of the work regarding the Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm (ECDSA) and encryption schemes played an important role in the security and privacy aspects of user authentication processes. I also took part in the integration of Keycloak for strong user authentication, where both user management and access control were very well streamlined, and the integration of NSQ for the messaging mechanism raised the performance of the communication within the system.</p>

											<p style="padding-left:30px" align="justify">In a dynamic role that was seasonal, I interacted with different people over several months, adapting to their unique needs and expectations to the best of my ability. The main responsibilities included planning recreational activities and excursions, as well as supporting them with the language, and filling a position as a sound and lighting technician during the evenings. <br>
												This developed my organizational skills and a high level of serviceability that suits all types of customers.</p>

										<h2>On the optimization of Software Obfuscation against Hardware Trojans in Microprocessors</h2>
										<blockquote><h4><em><a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9770162">IEEE pubblication</a> &nbsp | &nbsp Paper <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1ldbiQR70npwXymmAhE-Ff5kKoiKasD27/view?usp=sharing">here</a></em></h4>
										The quest for low production cost and short time-to-market, as well as the complexity of modern integrated circuits, pushed towards globalization of the supply chain of silicon devices. Such a production paradigm raised several security threats among which Hardware Trojan Horses (HTHs), which became a serious issue not only for academics but also for industry in the very last years. Indeed, it has been demonstrated that HTHs can be inserted into microprocessors allowing the attacker to run malicious software, acquire root privileges, and steal secret user information. <br>
											We present the use of software obfuscation to protect systems against HTHs that aim at stealing information from the microprocessor while it is executing a program. Moreover, we present a Genetic Algorithm-based approach to optimize the application of the anti-HTH methodology by maximizing the obtained obfuscation while minimizing the introduced overhead. <br>
											We proved the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed methodology on the Ariane 64bit RISC-V microprocessor running a set of MiBench benchmarks and cryptographic programs.</blockquote>

										<h2>The Cloud Resume Challenge</h2>
										<blockquote><h4><em><a href="https://github.com/litovn/CVcloud-challenge">Repository Link</a></em></h4>
										The Cloud Resume Challenge is a 16-step challenge designed for beginners to get hands-on experience with some of the tools and applications that DevOps Engineers and Cloud Architects use in their day-to-day tasks.<br>
											The steps outlined in the CRC were intentionally high-level and incredibly vague, providing a fun and sometimes challenging learning opportunity <a href="https://cloudresumechallenge.dev/docs/the-challenge/aws/">here</a>.</blockquote>
